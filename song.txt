[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you, no way
I always thought heroes stayed close
Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes

[Verse 2]
Every single word you told me
I believed without a question, always
To save all of us, you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself

[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
And you could store an ocean in the holes
In any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still had time, you had a chance
But you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave

[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?
Did you hope I'd never doubt?
Never one day work it out?
